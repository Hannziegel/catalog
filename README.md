# Catalog üíø üìö üìù

> This repo holds a command line interface app built with Ruby that will help users to keep a record of different types of things, like books, music albums, and games. The app is based on the UML class diagram provided in the README and includes a database schema analogical to the class structuture of the app.


## Built With :hammer_and_wrench:

- **Ruby:** Popular programming language that‚Äôs used for lots of things, from web app development to data analysis.
- **GitHub flow:**  Correct use of Branches for deployment and features development.
- **Linters Check (Rubocop):** Local and Pull Request check for errors, bugs and stylistic errors in code.
- **RSpec:** Unit test framework for the Ruby programming language.
- **SQL:** A standardized programming language that is used to manage relational databases and perform various operations on the data.
- **PostgreSQL** also known as Postgres, is a free and open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance.
